# PythonStdioGames
A compilation of text-based games written in Python that only use "standard i/o".


TODO NOTES:
Games should:

* Be under 256 lines long.

* Use only the standard library (or perhaps Colorama or PyTextCanvas)

* Only use print() and input() stdio text for input/output. (No graphics or mouse input.)

* Be well-commented.

* Have comments pointing out what lines can be changed.

* Have comments explaining their data structures.

* Have links to pythontutor.net to view run throughs.

* Have unit tests, which show how you can call the individual functions and see what they do with their input.

* Should I include type hints?

* Functions should only call functions that have already been defined (to aide a top-to-bottom reading of the code)

* Get rid of any functions that modify things in-place. Use tuples.

* Maybe include a barebones version of games, with stub functions that specify what their input/output, and hint at what other 
functions in the program they'll call? And the data structures used?
