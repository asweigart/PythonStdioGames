print('''Collatz Sequence, or, the 3n + 1 Problem
By Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

The Collatz sequence is a sequence of numbers produced from a starting
number n, following three rules:

1) If n is even, the next number n is n / 2.
2) If n is odd, the next number n is n * 3 + 1.
3) If n is 1, stop. Otherwise, repeat.

It is generally thought, but so far not mathematically proven, that
every starting number eventually terminates at 1.

n = int(response)

while n != 1:
    if n % 2 == 0:  # If n is even...
        n = n // 2
    else:  # Otherwise, n is odd...
        n = 3 * n + 1
