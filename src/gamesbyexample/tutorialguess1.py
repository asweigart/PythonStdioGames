"""Tutorial: Guess the Number, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

Part 1 of a tutorial to make a "Guess the Number" game, bit by bit."""

# Try copying the code in this program on your own and running the
# program before moving on to part 2. (You don't have to copy the
# comments.)

# Everything after a # is a "comment" and is ignored by the computer.
# You can use comments to write notes and reminders in your code.
# This program really only has three lines of actual code.

# Programs start executing instructions at the top of the file
# and go down.

# The print() function displays text on the screen. Notice that
# the ' single quotes are not printed:
print('Hello! What is your name?')

# The input() function lets the player type text in and press Enter. The
# text is stored in a variable named playerName:
playerName = input()

# This displays the name that the player typed in:
print('It is good to meet you, ' + playerName)
